Use your own URL Shortener or integrate 3rd Party Services with WordPress. Allows generating of shorturl with various services upon post/page publishing. 

== Description ==

[URL Shortener](http://fusedthought.com/downloads/url-shortener-wordpress-plugin/ "URL Shortener") plugin allows you to create your own short url using the WordPress Post ID (for eg: http://yoursite/POST-ID ). It provides two method of redirection, namely, wp_rewrite redirect and template_redirection (template redirect).

It also integrates multiple URL Shortening service with your WordPress.org installation bringing a similar functionality to that of WordPress.com's WP.me shortlinks feature but using 3rd party URL Shorteners. 

To show the generated links in your template just include this function within the loop:

`<?php fts_show_shorturl($post); ?>`


As of Version 1.5, I've added an on-demand shortening function for use in the templates:

`<?php fts_shorturl('http://www.google.com', 'supr'); ?>`


Version 1.5 also brings about an updated administration options page.

**Current supported services are:**

* tinyurl 
* is.gd 
* su.pr 
* bit.ly 
* tr.im
* short.ie 
* snipurl (aka Snurl / Snipr / Sn.im)
* cl.gs
* short.to
* ping.fm
* chilp.it
* smsh (aka sm00sh)
* u.nu
* unfake.it 
* awe.sm

**Notes on Awe.sm usage:**

*  Custom domain can be configured in your Awe.sm account on the awe.sm website.


**Future Versions:**

*  I am still looking into creating a URL Management page to manage all the generated URLs within the site.
*  Twitter and Facebook posting integration?
*  More services can be added upon request.
