Use your own URL Shortener or integrate 3rd Party Services with WordPress. Allows generating of shorturl with various services upon post/page publishing. 

== Description ==

[URL Shortener](http://fusedthought.com/downloads/url-shortener-wordpress-plugin/ "URL Shortener") integrates multiple URL Shortening service with your WordPress.org installation bringing a similar functionality to that of WordPress.com's WP.me shortlinks feature but using 3rd party URL Shorteners.

The Short URL generated during post/page publishing is cache and thus generated only once. Furthermore, as it uses the post ID to generate, changing the site permalinks will not break the Short URL.

You can also create your own short url using the WordPress Post ID (for eg: http://yoursite/POST-ID ). It provides two method of redirection, namely, wp_rewrite redirect and template_redirection (template redirect).

Version 2.1 provides integration with [Simply Tweeted](http://fusedthought.com/downloads/simply-tweeted-wordpress-plugin/ "Simply Tweeted") allowing you to automatically post the title and (Short)URL to twitter upon post/page publishing.

**Sample usage:**

To show the generated links in your template just include this function within the loop:

`<?php fts_show_shorturl($post); ?>`

On-demand shortening function (V1.5) is also for use in your templates:

`<?php fts_shorturl('http://www.google.com', 'supr'); ?>`


Latest: Version 2.0 now supports bulk editing and generation of Short URLs.
